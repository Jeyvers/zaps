# ZAPS  
**Tap-to-Pay & Scan-to-Pay Crypto Payments on Stellar**

ZAPS is a Stellar-native payment application that enables users to pay **directly with crypto** using **tap-to-pay (NFC)** or **scan-to-pay (QR)**, while merchants receive **instant USD settlement via Stellar Anchors**.

No Apple Pay.  
No Google Pay.  
No cards.  


Just crypto → payment → USD settlement.

## 🚨 Problem

Modern digital payments are controlled by closed, centralized platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay. These systems:

- Require bank-issued cards and intermediaries  
- Exclude billions without reliable banking access  
- Lock merchants into proprietary ecosystems  
- Offer no native way to spend crypto  

Meanwhile, crypto users still cannot easily spend their assets in the real world without first cashing out.

**Crypto is global and instant — but spending it isn’t.**

---

## 💡 Solution

ZAPS removes Big Tech wallets entirely.

Users:
- Transfer crypto directly into the ZAPS app  
- Pay in-store or online using **tap** or **scan**  
- Settle payments directly on the Stellar blockchain  

Merchants:
- Price goods in USD  
- Accept crypto without volatility  
- Receive USD instantly via Stellar Anchors  
- Withdraw to local bank accounts  

ZAPS turns Stellar into a **global, open payment network**.

3. User taps phone
4. Transaction is signed and submitted to Stellar
5. Merchant receives USD instantly

---

## 💱 Asset & Settlement Model

### User Pays With

### Merchant Receives
- USD via Stellar Anchors  

If user pays in XLM:

## 🏦 Stellar Anchors

ZAPS relies on Stellar Anchors for:
- Fiat custody
- Stablecoin issuance
- Compliance (KYB / AML)
- Bank off-ramps

### Initial Target Regions
- Nigeria (USD domiciliary accounts)
- Kenya (USD → MPesa Global)
- Ghana (USD bank payouts)
- South Africa (USD settlement rails)
- USA / EU (regulated anchors)

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- Non-custodial wallet by default
- Encrypted key storage
- Biometric authentication
- Merchant KYB required
- User KYC risk-based
- AML monitoring via Anchors

---

- **Wallet:** Stellar SDK (JS / Mobile)
- **Payments:** Path Payments, SEP-7 URIs
- **Anchors:** SEP-6 / SEP-24 / SEP-31
